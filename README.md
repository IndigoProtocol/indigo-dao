Indigo Protocol is a synthetics platform deployed on the Cardano
blockchain. It connects the real-world to the blockchain, giving
everybody equal access to financial opportunities.

Documents
---------

This repository stores one document:

1.  **Indigo DAO Constitution** -- describes the rules set forth and
    adopted by the Indigo DAO Members

Usage
-----

To generate the PDF files yourself, you can use `pdflatex`:

    pdflatex --shell-escape constitution.tex

These documents are intended to be recorded on-chain after the launch of
Indigo Protocol. More information about how to verify documents on-chain
will be provided after Indigo Protocol mainnet launch.

Verifying Authenticity
----------------------

Each time a PDF is generated by `pdflatex` the metadata may change. This
can cause the hash of the document to differ between compiles even if
content hasn't changed.

To remove metadata, use `mat2`:

    mat2 --inplace constitution.pdf

This will remove metadata so that hashing will be consistent:

    $ sha256sum constitution.pdf
    5ee5f032c90893a35ffe75c2d35e0a0d71fad9292360ae3fe1052efef896689a  constitution.pdf

Documents with metadata removed can be shared and distributed. Users can
verify that they're looking at the correct document by generating the
hash and comparing it to a reference.
